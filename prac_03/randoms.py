# Question 1
# What did you see on line 1?
# The smallest number I saw was 7 and the largest was 19.
# The smallest number which could have been seen is 5 and the largest 20.

# Question 2
# What did you see on line 2?
# I saw a lot of 7's, and one 5 and one 9.
# The smallest number I could have seen was 3 and the largest was 9.
# The line could not have produced a 4 and the numbers are increasing in multiples of 2,
# and therefore only the odd numbers can be shown.

# Question 3
# What did you see on line 3?
# I saw many different numbers with lots of decimal places, varying from approximately 2.5 to 5.
# The smallest number I could have seen is 2.5 and the largest is 5.5.
