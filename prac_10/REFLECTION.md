# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I personally found I usually underestimated the time the overall task took, with the majority of my actual time
spent being greater than the estimate, by either a small or large amount.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I believe my estimate accuracy remained around the same, if anything I allowed for a greater amount of time
as the tasks went on. I do not believe this improved my overall estimate accuracy however, but it did work
to accommodate for the large amount of time spent on some of the practical tasks.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I further learnt to roughly estimate the amount of time a task would take me by looking over the entire task,
and upon reflection I think this would be a useful skill to improve and apply across tasks for other subjects when
it comes to planning out my time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

From being reviewed by other people, I have learnt my module docstrings could be better, and there are small error
throughout my code which could be improved. The code still works properly, but through the code reviews, the
reviewers have identified areas across my code where the code could be written better (practical 5 and 6 code
reviews) and still produce the same output, for example moving lines outside of try and excepts statements that
say the same thing (code review from week 5).

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Through the process of reviewing others code for code reviews, I have found I really have to pay attention to
the overall structure and all aspects of their code, which I feel improves my understanding of the code slightly
as well.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/PlasticStrawActivist/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

In this code review, I believe I commented in a tone which would have allowed the author to respond and look into
what I had written in a welcoming way. I feel as if I asked valid questions which hopefully helped the author in
their understanding of the code applications.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review 2](https://github.com/LachlanFern/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

In this code review, I feel as if my main comments were bringing to light small things which could have been improved
by the author in a positive tone. I believe my messages were written in a constructive way to help the author improve
their overall code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would change the practical tasks slightly. While I believe most of the
tasks are useful in enhancing my understanding of the concepts taught in class, I think some of the practical
tasks - the project management tasks from practical 7 could be shortened. Furthermore, I feel while
the majority of the tasks are relevant to what we have learnt, I would modify practical 10 to relate to what we
have learnt in the subject. I would potentially restructure practical 10 to be a collection of tasks from what
we have learnt throughout the subject, as this would further assist in exam revision as well.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Through the practicals in this subject, I feel as if I did a good job in completing the overall tasks to produce
their desired output and have been learning throughout the way. Furthermore, I always had the practicals and code
reviews submitted on time.
