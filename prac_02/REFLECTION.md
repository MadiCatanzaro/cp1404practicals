# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

At the beginning of the week, usually sometime on Monday at home - ensuring I have watched them before 
Tuesday's seminar.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Keeping up with the content and working through the practicals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I feel I could be more engaged in the seminars, and I will try to watch the lecture videos on Sunday to allow myself 
additional time to understand the content instead of occasionally 'rushing' through the videos.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I will try and allocate extra time to attempt the practise and extension tasks to ensure I'm learning 
as much as possible.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I feel I am understanding what is being asked of me and, I am able to generate the code following what we have learnt 
in class.
