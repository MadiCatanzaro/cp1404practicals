# CP1404 Practicals

## Trimester 3, 2025 - Madalyn Catanzaro

I am a second year Electrical Engineering student at James Cook University who is completing the tasks in this
repository.
This repository contains the weekly practical tasks and submissions for the CP1404 subject.

The main lessons I have learnt about "clean code" in this subject are:

- Clean and readable code is essential
- Naming is very important in enhancing the readability of the code
- Choose the best (and right) tool for the job

The teachings of the subject include
the [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#menus)
and the [CP1404 Practicals instructions repository](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals).
