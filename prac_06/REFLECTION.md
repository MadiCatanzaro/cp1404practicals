# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have attempted to watch the lecture videos earlier which I believe has helped slightly but has not made a drastic
difference overall. Whether I can watch the videos earlier is usually dependent on my other classes and their content.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think if I start the practical tasks ahead of the Thursday practical session, I will allocate myself more time
to understand the tasks and produce the best possible response.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am completing the required submission items ontime, and attending all seminars and practical sessions to ensure
I'm maximising my learning.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I believe I should potentially change my practical approach, to allow myself more time as said above, which may
allow the completion of the practise and extension tasks. Additionally, I feel as if I could be more engaged when
watching the lecture videos, which I will attempt to do.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I personally feel it may be useful to do more practical tasks in the seminars, or more practise exam questions
since the theory has already been covered in the pre-lecture videos.
